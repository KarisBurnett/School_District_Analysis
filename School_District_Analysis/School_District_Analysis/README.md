# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the School District analysis
Thomas High School school of board is concerned about 9th graders reading and math grades. They beleive that the grades have been altered and have asked Maria for help. Maria has asked me to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Also complete a school analysis for a better understanding. 
## Results
## How is the district summary affected
There were a total of 15 schools in the district. When assessing the data I noticed the average math score dropped .1, the average reading score stayed the same, the percentage of passing math dropped 1%, the percentage passing reading dropped 1%, and the overall passing percent dropped 1%.

## How is the School Summary Affected and Performance Levels of THS Math and Reading Scores
When assessing school summaries, the score replacements did affect the ranking of the top five performing schools. Thomas High School ranked second place in the top five performing schools with a 91% overall passing. After replacing both math and reading scores with nans, Thomas High School was taken out of the top five category since they now have a 65% overall passing. These changes did not place Thomas High School among the bottom five performing schools and instead the school is ranked 8th.

## How Does Replacing the 9th Grade Scores Affect: 
Math and Reading Scores by grade: Fortunately the math and reading scores were not changed when replaced with nan. Math scores were lower than reading overall.

Scores by School Size: Removing the ninth grade scores did not affect the avg math and reading scores however it did affect the passing percentages for medium-sized schools. Before the data change the School Size summary showed that medium sized schools has a higher performance compared to small and large schools. However, the data change is now showing that medium size schools are the second in performance.
